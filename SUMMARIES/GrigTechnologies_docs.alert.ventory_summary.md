# Repository Summary: GrigTechnologies/docs.alert.ventory

1.  **Project Goal & Core Functionality:**
    *   The project appears to be a documentation website for an inventory management and alerting system called "alert.ventory". The website aims to provide information on getting started, features, database structure, and roles/permissions within the system.
    *   Key features documented: Inventory Management, Alerting, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Email Group Management.

2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Languages:** Primarily Markdown, with some Python snippets in documentation.
    *   **Frameworks/Libraries:** Docusaurus, Mermaid (for diagrams).
    *   **Key Dependencies:** Not applicable, since this is a documentation website. However, the documentation mentions interactions with an API and a Database (ER Diagram exists).
    *   **Infrastructure/Ops:** GitHub Pages for hosting, GitHub Actions for CI/CD (deployment to GitHub Pages).

3.  **Repository Structure Overview (Based on `tree.txt` if available, otherwise inferred):**
    *   `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflow files (deployment).
    *   `docs/`: Contains the main documentation content, organized into categories (getting started, features, database, roles & permissions).
    *   `src/`: Contains Docusaurus-related code (custom CSS, homepage components).
    *   `static/`: Contains static assets such as images, favicons, and the logo.

4.  **Key Files & Entry Points:**
    *   Configuration Files: `package.json`, `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`.
    *   Entry Points: `src/pages/index.js` (homepage), `README.md`.
    *   Build/Deployment: `.github/workflows/deployment.yml`
    *   Key application logic files: The primary logic of the "alert.ventory" system itself is not in this repository; the code is for *documenting* it. Documentation includes "Application Flow" (`docs/features/application-flow.md`), and "Database Structure" (`docs/database/database-er-diagram.md`).
    *   Documentation: `README.md` (basic project overview), `docs/` directory with multiple Markdown files.

5.  **Development & Usage Hints (Inferred):**
    *   **Setup/Installation:** `yarn install` (or simply `yarn` as described in `README.md`).
    *   **Running:** `yarn start` (starts a local development server for Docusaurus).
    *   **Building:** `yarn build` (builds the static website). The output directory is `build/` (as defined in .gitignore).
    *   **Deployment:** GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deployment.yml`) deploys the `build/` directory to GitHub Pages. Requires a `TOKEN_GITHUB` secret.
    *   **Testing:** Not specified.  Only linting is apparent by inference via `eslint.config.js` (though no `lint` script is defined).
    *   *Constraint:* Testing mechanisms apart from linting not specified in the provided input.

6.  **Notable Patterns & Conventions (Inferred):**
    *   Use of Docusaurus for generating a static website.
    *   Component-based architecture within the `src/components/` directory (specifically `HomepageFeatures`).
    *   Use of Mermaid for Database ER Diagrams.

7.  **Overall Impression & Potential Use Case:**
    *   A documentation website for the alert.ventory system, built using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages, providing comprehensive information on its features, roles/permissions, and database structure.
