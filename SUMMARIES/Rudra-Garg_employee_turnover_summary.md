# Repository Summary: Rudra-Garg/employee_turnover

1.  **Project Goal & Core Functionality:**
    *   The project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning models. The core functionality involves data loading, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and saving.
    *   Key features:
        *   Training and tuning of multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a Neural Network).
        *   Feature engineering including interaction terms, polynomial features, and feature scaling.
        *   Cross-validation for robust model evaluation.

2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Languages:** Python.
    *   **Frameworks/Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, tensorflow, seaborn, matplotlib, joblib.
    *   **Key Dependencies:** No explicit external backend API dependency detected from provided contents.
    *   **Infrastructure/Ops:** No Dockerfile is available. Results and models are saved to local directories.

3.  **Repository Structure Overview (Based on `tree.txt` if available, otherwise inferred):**
    *   `.`: Root directory contains configuration files, data, and the main Python script.
    *   `saved_models/`: Stores trained models and generated plots.
    *   Test directories/files are not directly apparent.

4.  **Key Files & Entry Points:**
    *   Configuration files: `config.py` contains settings for data loading, feature engineering, model training, and saving.
    *   Application entry points: `employee_turnover.py` is the main script that orchestrates the entire process.
    *   Build/deployment-related files: None directly available.
    *   Key application logic files:
        * `employee_turnover.py`: implements the `EmployeeTurnoverPredictor` class, managing data loading, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and saving.
        * `config.py`: defines the parameters for various models.
    *   Documentation file: No `README.md` file detected.

5.  **Development & Usage Hints (Inferred):**
    *   **Setup/Installation:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **Running:** `python employee_turnover.py`
    *   **Building:** No explicit build process specified; likely no separate build step needed for this Python script.
    *   **Deployment:** Deployment process not specified.
    *   **Testing:** Linting not apparent from the input. Testing setup not specified.

6.  **Notable Patterns & Conventions (Inferred):**
    *   Configuration driven approach with a central `CONFIG` dictionary.
    *   Object-oriented design with the `EmployeeTurnoverPredictor` class.
    *   Extensive use of scikit-learn for data processing and traditional ML.
    *   Use of `tensorflow` to create a neural network model.
    *   Standard logging for debugging and tracking progress.
    *   Use of datetime stamp to create versioned folders for each run.
    *   Hyperparameter tuning by GridSearchCV.

7.  **Overall Impression & Potential Use Case:**
    *   A Python-based machine learning project focused on employee turnover prediction, leveraging feature engineering and multiple classification algorithms including a neural network. It uses a configuration-driven approach for training and saves models locally, lacking CI/CD integration or external API interactions.
