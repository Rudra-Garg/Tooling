# Repository Summary: Rudra-Garg/Clinikk_TV

1.  **Project Goal & Core Functionality:**
    *   The project is a backend service (proof-of-concept) for a media (video and audio) content management and streaming platform. It also includes user authentication functionality.
    *   Key features include: Media Content Management (CRUD operations and streaming), User Authentication (registration and JWT-based login), and Storage Integration (AWS S3).

2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Languages:** Python.
    *   **Frameworks/Libraries:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Boto3, Python-jose, Passlib.
    *   **Key Dependencies:** PostgreSQL for the database, AWS S3 for media storage, JWT for authentication. There's no indication of a frontend or other external API except for S3.
    *   **Infrastructure/Ops:** Docker, Docker Compose for containerization.  The presence of a `.env.example` file suggests environment variable configuration.  There are no apparent CI/CD pipelines defined in the provided files.

3.  **Repository Structure Overview (Based on `tree.txt` if available, otherwise inferred):**
    *   The repository structure consists of the following main directories:
        *   `controllers/`: Contains the controller layer, responsible for handling business logic.
        *   `models/`: Contains the SQLAlchemy models that define the database schema.
        *   `routes/`: Contains the API route definitions using FastAPI routers.
        *   `schemas/`: Contains the Pydantic schemas for request and response data validation.
        *   `services/`: Contains the service layer, which implements core application features and interacts with external services.
        *   `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
        *   `utils/`: Contains utility modules for database management, logging, password handling, and security.
    *   The core application logic resides in `main.py`, `controllers/`, `services/`, and `routes/`.
    *   There is no `public/` directory.
    *   Test files are present in the `tests/` directory.

4.  **Key Files & Entry Points:**
    *   Configuration files: `config.py`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Application entry points: `main.py`.
    *   Build/deployment-related files: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Key application logic files:
        *   `controllers/content_controllers.py`: Handles content-related operations.
        *   `services/auth_service.py`: Handles user authentication and authorization.
        *   `services/storage_service.py`: Handles interaction with AWS S3.
        *   `routes/content_routes.py`: Defines routes for content management.
        *   `routes/auth_routes.py`: Defines routes for user authentication.
        *   `models/content.py`, `models/user.py`: Define the data models.
    *   Main documentation file: `README.md` (content is present and describes the project).

5.  **Development & Usage Hints (Inferred):**
    *   **Setup/Installation:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **Running:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
    *   **Building:** `docker-compose up --build`.
    *   **Deployment:** Docker Compose is used for deployment; AWS S3 and PostgreSQL credentials are required as environment variables.  The `.env.example` file shows the required variables.
    *   **Testing:** `pytest`.
    *   The provided files contain unit tests located in the `tests/` directory.

6.  **Notable Patterns & Conventions (Inferred):**
    *   Layered architecture (API, Controller, Service, Data Access).
    *   Dependency injection using FastAPI's `Depends`.
    *   Pydantic schemas for data validation.
    *   SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.
    *   AWS S3 integration for media storage with boto3.
    *   JWT-based authentication.
    *   Asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`.
    *   Logging using Python's `logging` module.

7.  **Overall Impression & Potential Use Case:**
    *   A backend service for a media streaming platform built using Python/FastAPI, providing content management, user authentication, and storage integration with AWS S3.  The service is containerized using Docker and utilizes PostgreSQL for data persistence.
