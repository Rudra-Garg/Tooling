# Repository Summary: GrigTechnologies/request.ventory

1.  **Project Goal & Core Functionality:**
    *   The project is a backend API named "request.ventory" that manages inventories, handles user authentication, and facilitates email communication. It likely supports user sign-up, login, inventory creation/management, and item management within inventories.
    *   Key features include: User authentication with JWT, inventory management (CRUD operations on items, categories, images), and email OTP verification using Flask-Mail.

2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Languages:** Python.
    *   **Frameworks/Libraries:** Flask, Flask-RESTX, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-Mail, Flask-CORS, Gunicorn, SQLAlchemy.
    *   **Key Dependencies:** Firebase Admin SDK (for interacting with Firebase Firestore and Storage), Supabase (PostgreSQL database accessed using SQLAlchemy).
    *   **Infrastructure/Ops:** Docker (Dockerfile for containerization), GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines for Docker image building and pushing), Kubernetes (k8s manifests suggest deployment to a Kubernetes cluster using ingress for external access), Let's Encrypt(certificate manager).

3.  **Repository Structure Overview (Based on inferred structure):**
    *   `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflow definitions for CI/CD.
    *   `app.py`: Likely the main application entry point, initializes Flask and its extensions.
    *   `configs/`: Stores configuration files, including Firebase Admin SDK credentials (`firebase_adminSDK.json`) and Flask configurations (`flask_config.json`, `restx_config.json`).
    *   `controllers/`: Contains business logic and request handling functions, separated into `auth_controllers/` and `inventory_controllers/` and `user_controllers/`.
    *   `defaults/`: Contains default data for categories, prices and tags that are stored in Firestore.
    *   `handlers/`: Contains modules for default data handling and creating HTTP responses.
    *   `k8s/`: Contains Kubernetes manifest files for deployment.
    *   `logs/`: Contains directory to store log files.
    *   `mailer/`: Contains email templates and functionality for sending emails.
    *   `models/`: Contains data models and database interaction logic using both Firestore and potentially a PostgreSQL database via Supabase.
    *   `restx/`: Configuration, documentation, and models related to the Flask-RESTX API.
    *   `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints, organized into `auth.py`, `inventory.py`, and `user.py`.
    *   `supabase/`: Files related to PostgreSQL database integration via Supabase.
    *   `utils/`: Contains utility functions for cryptography, inventory management, JSON handling, token management, and UUID generation.
    *   `validators/`: Contains modules for request validation, includes general, inventory and user validators.

4.  **Key Files & Entry Points:**
    *   **Configuration:** `configs/flask_config.json`, `configs/firebase_adminSDK.json`, `configs/restx_config.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `kustomization.yaml`, `.gitignore`.
    *   **Entry Points:** `app.py` (Flask application), `k8s/deployment.yaml`.
    *   **Build/Deployment:** `.github/workflows/dev.yml`, `.github/workflows/main.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `k8s/*`.
    *   **Application Logic:** `controllers/*`, `models/*`, `routes/*`, `utils/*`.
    *   **Documentation:** `README.md` (minimal), `mailer/README.md`, `configs/README.md`, auto-generated Swagger UI through Flask-RESTX.

5.  **Development & Usage Hints (Inferred):**
    *   **Setup/Installation:** `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. Needs `firebase_adminSDK.json` and `flask_config.json` set up. Might require environment variables for Supabase (`.env` in supabase).
    *   **Running:** `python app.py` or running the Docker container. Likely run through Gunicorn (`CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]`).
    *   **Building:** `docker build -t grigtechnologies/request.ventory:latest .`.
    *   **Deployment:** Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub. Kubernetes manifests suggest deploying to a Kubernetes cluster. GitHub Actions workflows use secrets for Docker Hub credentials and configuration files.
    *   **Testing:** Validation logic in `validators/` suggests API input validation. Not explicit test setup is apparent.

6.  **Notable Patterns & Conventions (Inferred):**
    *   Flask-RESTX for API development, RESTful API design.
    *   JWT authentication for users and inventory access.
    *   Firebase for backend services: Firestore for data storage, Storage for image storage.
    *   Email communication with OTP using Flask-Mail and HTML templates.
    *   Input validation using custom validator functions.
    *   Layered architecture: routes, controllers, models, utils, validators.
    *   Use of environment variables (e.g., for database credentials).

7.  **Overall Impression & Potential Use Case:**
    *   A backend API built with Flask and Firebase for inventory management and user authentication, designed for deployment within a containerized environment (Docker/Kubernetes) and utilizing PostgreSQL via Supabase alongside Firebase.
