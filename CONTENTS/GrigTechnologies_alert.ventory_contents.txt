## Getting Started

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd alert.ventory
```

### Environment Setup

Environment variables are crucial for configuring the application.
Create a `.env` file in the project root. This file will store your local configuration for running the application directly or for providing build arguments if needed.

Example key variables for a root `.env` file:

```
# Database (adjust for your local/target PostgreSQL setup)
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost # or your DB host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=alert_ventory_db
TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id # e.g., public or a specific schema user prefix for Supabase/Postgres
# SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI can be constructed or set directly:
# SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://{DB_USER}.{TENANT_ID}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}
# If not using tenant_id in username:
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}

# Supabase (if using Supabase client directly for some operations like storage)
SUPABASE_URL=http://your_supabase_instance_url # e.g., http://localhost:8000 if running Supabase locally
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# JWT
SECRET_KEY=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key_for_jwt_please_change_me
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# Zoho OAuth
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_zoho_client_id
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoho_client_secret
ZOHO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8123/auth/callback # Example, adjust as needed for your deployment
ZOHO_TOKEN_URL=https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token # Or your Zoho DC's token URL

# SMTP (for sending emails)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_server.com
SMTP_PORT=587 # or 465 for SSL
SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com # Default sender address

# Temporal
TEMPORAL_HOST=localhost # Address of your Temporal frontend service
TEMPORAL_PORT=7233
# TEMPORAL_URL can be constructed or set directly:
# TEMPORAL_URL=${TEMPORAL_HOST}:${TEMPORAL_PORT}
```

These variables will be used by the application when run locally and can also be baked into the Docker image or supplied to the container at runtime.

## Running Locally

This method is for running the API server and workers directly on your machine, without using the main application Docker image.

### Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use pip-compile if requirements.in is the primary source of dependencies.

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If requirements.txt is already up-to-date:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible as configured in your root `.env` file.

Apply Database Migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Initialize Roles, Permissions, and Admin Users:

The application attempts to do this on startup via `init_db()` in `models/__init__.py`.
If you need to run it manually (e.g., for setup scripts or troubleshooting):

```bash
python -c "from models import init_db; init_db()"
```

### Run API Server

```bash
python run_api.py
# Or, for development with auto-reload:
# uvicorn run_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8123 --reload
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8123.
OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation: http://localhost:8123/docs.

### Run Temporal Workers

Ensure your Temporal server is running and accessible (configured in your root `.env`).

In a separate terminal window:

```bash
python run_worker.py
```

This will start the email workers, listening to task queues defined in `workers/email_workers.py`.

## Building and Pushing Docker Image

This project includes a root Dockerfile designed for building a portable application image. This image can be configured at runtime to start as either an API server or a Temporal worker via the `SERVICE_TYPE` environment variable (`api` or `worker`).

Use docker buildx to build a multi-platform image (if needed, though the example below specifies linux/amd64) and push it to a container registry.

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t harbor.grigtech.io/alert.ventory/backend:0.1.0 --push .
```

Explanation of the command:
- `docker buildx build`: Invokes the buildx builder.
- `--platform linux/amd64`: Specifies the target platform for the image. You can specify multiple platforms if needed (e.g., linux/amd64,linux/arm64).
- `-t harbor.grigtech.io/alert.ventory/backend:0.1.0`: Tags the image with the given name and tag. Replace with your registry and desired tag.
- `--push`: Pushes the image to the specified registry after a successful build. Ensure you are logged into the registry (`docker login harbor.grigtech.io`).
- `.`: Specifies the build context (the current directory), which means Docker will use the Dockerfile located in the project root.

After building and pushing, this image can be deployed to any container orchestration platform. Remember to provide the necessary environment variables (as defined in `.env`) to the running container.

## API Endpoints Overview

The application exposes several groups of API endpoints:

- `/auth`: User authentication, token generation, and refresh.
- `/users`: User management (CRUD operations, role assignments).
- `/rbac`: Role and Permission management.
- `/email-groups`: Management of email distribution groups.
- `/emails`: Sending emails (immediate, scheduled, recurring) and handling confirmations.
- `/storage`: File upload, download, and management.
- `/tabs`: User-specific state/data management.
- `/workflows`: Listing user's workflows, checking status, and termination.

For a detailed and interactive API specification, run the application locally and navigate to `/docs` in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:8123/docs).

## Testing

The project uses pytest for automated testing.

Install test dependencies (if not already installed with main requirements):

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
# or ensure pytest and related plugins are in your main requirements.txt
```

Run tests from the project root directory:

```bash
pytest
```

Test results and coverage information (if configured) might be output to the console or specific files (e.g., results_cov.txt).

## Configuration

- **Core Settings**: Primarily managed via environment variables loaded from a `.env` file (see Environment Setup). These are used both for local runs and should be supplied to Docker containers.
- **Static Data**:
  - Initial roles and their permissions: `configs/roles_permissions.json`
  - Initial admin user emails: `configs/admin.json`
- **Service Configurations**: Specific configurations for database, JWT, SMTP, and Temporal client are modularized within the `configs/` directory.
- **Database Schema**: Managed by Alembic (see `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` directory).

Filename: docker/dynamicconfig/README.md
Content:
Use `docker.yaml` file to override the default dynamic config value (they are specified
when creating the service config).

Each key can have zero or more values and each value can have zero or more
constraints. There are only three types of constraint:
1. `namespace`: `string`
2. `taskQueueName`: `string`
3. `taskType`: `int` (`1`:`Workflow`, `2`:`Activity`)
A value will be selected and returned if all its has exactly the same constraints
as the ones specified in query filters (including the number of constraints).

Please use the following format:
```
testGetBoolPropertyKey:
  - value: false
  - value: true
    constraints:
      namespace: "global-samples-namespace"
  - value: false
    constraints:
      namespace: "samples-namespace"
testGetDurationPropertyKey:
  - value: "1m"
    constraints:
      namespace: "samples-namespace"
      taskQueueName: "longIdleTimeTaskqueue"
testGetFloat64PropertyKey:
  - value: 12.0
    constraints:
      namespace: "samples-namespace"
testGetMapPropertyKey:
  - value:
      key1: 1
      key2: "value 2"
      key3:
        - false
        - key4: true
          key5: 2.0
```

## Services

### Core Application
- **API Service**: FastAPI application running on port 8123
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase
- **Temporal Workflow Engine**: For managing distributed workflows and tasks

### Supabase Services
- **Studio**: Supabase admin interface
- **Kong**: API Gateway
- **Auth**: Authentication service
- **REST**: PostgREST API
- **Realtime**: Real-time subscriptions
- **Storage**: File storage service
- **Meta**: Database management
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions
- **Analytics**: Log management
- **Connection Pooler**: Database connection pooling

### Temporal Stack
- **Temporal Server**: Main workflow engine
- **Temporal UI**: Web interface (port 8088)
- **Temporal PostgreSQL**: Dedicated database (port 5433)
- **Admin Tools**: CLI tools for Temporal management

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection (port 9090)
- **Grafana**: Metrics visualization (port 3001)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary variables:


## Usage

### Starting the Stack
Start all services:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Stopping the Stack

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove volumes:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f api
```

### Service Access

- FastAPI Application: http://localhost:8123
- Supabase Studio: http://localhost:3000
- Temporal UI: http://localhost:8088
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

## Maintenance

### Database Backups

The PostgreSQL data is persisted in `./volumes/db/data`. Regular backups can be configured based on requirements.

### Updating Services

1. Pull the latest images:
```bash
docker compose pull
```

2. Rebuild custom services:
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache api
```

3. Restart the stack:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is healthy: `docker compose ps db`
   - Check database logs: `docker compose logs db`
   - Ensure correct environment variables in `.env`

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - Services are configured with health checks and proper startup order
   - If services fail to start, check the logs for dependency issues

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Ensure no other services are using the configured ports
   - Ports can be modified in docker-compose.yml if needed

### Health Checks

Monitor service health:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Development

### Local Development

1. Create a development environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Modify environment variables as needed

3. Start required services:
```bash
docker compose up -d 
```

### Building Custom Images

```bash
docker compose build api --no-cache
```

## Security Notes

1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Regularly update service images for security patches
3. Use strong passwords for all services
4. Review and restrict network access as needed
5. Monitor service logs for security events
